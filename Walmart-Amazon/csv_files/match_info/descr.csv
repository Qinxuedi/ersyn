*14 megapixel resolution kodak 36-108mm zoom lens 21 scene modes

smartphone so you can set ovi maps to offline mode saving battery power and the navigation system will still work. this is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.   best global coverage   you take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so as standard voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries. this gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free.

**empowers you to save hundreds on electric bills and more                          many appliances continue to consume power even when they re turned off   the p4480 stops appliances from consuming this stolen power    plug in your existing surge protector to monitor and ration multiple appliances at once   calculates electricity expense by day week month or year   informative graphic display is easy to read   built-in surge protector guards against voltage spikes   flexible timer functionality can be paired with lamps and lighting to help keep your home safe                          are your electric bills costing you a fortune cut costs and take control of your electrical appliances with the kill a watt graphic timer.   this advanced timer has the ability to monitor 2 tasks at once. first it serves as a catalyst to turn your household appliances on and off as it simultaneously monitors its energy consumption so you can have total control of your electricity usage even when you are not at home. with up to 96 different programmable power on off event settings per day and 7 different combinations for the different days of the week makes this device the smartest and easiest to use timer out there.    not only is it a thrifty device but the kill a watt gt p4480 is also the perfect tool to ward off would-be thieves by turning on and off a connected lamp at random times giving your empty home the appearance of being occupied. the kill a watt function helps you save money and protects your appliances. now you can save energy by using lights and electronics only when you need them. the built in surge protector also guards your appliance from voltage spikes. with the simple press of a button you can read the consumption by the kilowatt-hour and calculate electricity expenses by the day week month or year.    the kill a watt graphic timer is a 3-in-1 product. it is a graphic timer with a power meter built-in that serves as a surge protector. it presents the information to you in a simple easy-to-understand format.      easy to use with many practical applications             large lcd display counts consumption by the kilowatt-hour              this is one of the most sophisticated timers on the market and yet is very easy to understand. it s a digital version of a straightforward mechanical timer with a visual interface. it is easy to program the quarter-hour on off periods for 7-days and 24-hours as you would program traditional mechanical timers. unlike other timers the graphic timer is not limited to one day of programming--the unit allows unique programs for each of the 7-days of the week. measurements and programming are stored in memory and retained during power outages. a backup battery allows armchair programming before you even plug it in.    this fully loaded surge protector doesn t just guard your electrical devices from voltage spikes. it also provides protection against over current over voltage and under voltage delivering clean safe power to your expensive equipment. when the voltage presented at the wall outlet is over or under the normal voltage range the unit will switch to abnormal voltage mode shutting off the power at the outlet. similarly when the current load presented by the connected appliance exceeds the maximum current 15a the unit will switch to over current mode and the power will be switched off to the outlet. the gt also helps prolong the lifespan of your appliances by gently applying start-up power via its zero power crossing spike-free switch.    the power meter once connected to your appliance will assess how efficient they really are. the large lcd display will count consumption by the kilowatt hour same as your local utility. you can track minute-by-minute changes in electric consumption as major appliances are turned on and off. it lets you track the amount of electricity that your household uses in real time. it helps you reduce your energy consumption and decrease your monthly bills while helping the environment. also check the quality of your power by monitoring line voltage. the unit displays the total cumulative appliance power consumption in kilowatt hours kwh . the unit will display kwh from 0.01 kwh to 9999 kwh.    examples of the different uses of the kill a watt graphic timer             test your energy usage set up a 7-day timer and more                you can plug your entertainment center s power strip into the gt and program it to turn off when you are not home to avoid any standby power from flat-panel tvs and cable boxes that suck up huge amounts of electricity even when not in use. if you need to use a connected product the conveniently located on off control allows a temporary override without changing the timer settings. you can go back to the timer mode very easily by hitting the auto button. this neat feature allows you to use power only when needed and gives you total control of your appliances. according to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory a surprisingly large number of electrical products--tvs to microwave ovens to air conditioners--cannot be switched off completely without being unplugged. these products draw power 24-hours a day often without the knowledge of the consumer. we call this power consumption standby power. use the kill a watt as a 7-day timer with up to 96 on off cycles per day. you can conveniently program your christmas lights to go on off in a wide variety of programming options set differently for each day of the week. e.g. stay on longer in the weekends or go on earlier on wednesdays.    plug your lamp into the unit and use it as a security guard. it wards off would-be thieves by turning a connected lamp on and off at random times giving your empty home the appearance of being occupied.    test for yourself and observe the results     put the gt to the test and see how you can save money on your electricity bill. program the gt and plug your entertainment center s power strip but keep the timer function off. measure one week s cumulative power consumption in kwhs and retain the information in your records. now turn on the timer function the following week which will eliminate any standby power that will otherwise be used by the appliances in your entertainment center. compare the 2-week records and see how many kwhs you have saved. multiply the kwhs saved by the rate your utility provider charges for electricity and it will give you the total money saved that week by using the kill a watt graphic timer.        technical

installation   masterfully engineered to deliver maximum sound in a minimal enclosure space the champion series pro subwoofer is designed to fit a variety of spaces. from under the front seats and behind the back seats to inside doors and under the dash your install can be customized to fit your needs.    built to last   the champion series pro subwoofer combines innovative technology with top quality materials to consistently deliver superior performance. this subwoofer houses a three-layer wide-roll fiber-woven radial surround that provides phenomenal power handling with minimal distortion. the enduring strength of this subwoofer comes from its aluminum die-cast chassis double stacked magnets patented air suspension system and rigid lightweight impp cone.             ts-w2502d2 features    air suspension system   for its revolutionary 3.25 inch deep shallow subwoofer pioneer created an air suspension system effective within a 70 smaller-than-previous enclosure that locks air for a spring-like effect between main and drive cones moving in unison. the result is consistently clear powerful wide-ranging bass response. the subwoofer s dual cone structure maintains better sound linearity and reliability after hours of hard use than conventional subwoofers with spider structures to keep the voice coil aligned. this incredible technology is applied to this new generation of high output high performance subwoofers.    double-stack magnet with double-stack top plate   to produce the tremendous magnetic energy we envisioned for this sub we employed double-stacked magnets weighing a hefty 110oz and a double-stacked top plate above them. this design ensures positive powerful control of the voice coil during those long excursions--and it s one reason you can ring up those high spl numbers.    wide-roll 3-layer fiber radial surround   a sub s surround plays a key role in a speaker s performance. in order for bass response to be clear and tight the surround has to respond evenly around its entire circumference without flexing or puckering even at high volume levels. that s why pioneer created a surround consisting of two layers of urethane with a layer of interwoven fiber between them. it s strong stable and it reduces distortion. in addition the wider-than-normal design provides a long linear excursion for excellent control and heavy-duty durability.    interlaced basalt carbon fiber reinforced impp cone   to ensure that you get more natural bass pioneer incorporated their new basalt fiber technology into their shallow subwoofers. the volcanic-rock fibers create a cone that is lightweight rigid well damped stable in temperature extremes and more environmentally friendly. in short this bass really rocks.    cast aluminum basket   designed from scratch by pioneer this one-piece aluminum basket assembly holds the motor assembly cone and magnet structure securely in place. the benefits of this design reduced internal stress superior damping and increased magnetic efficiency.    dual voice coil   the ts-w2502d2 d4 provides two voice coils each either at dual 2 or dual 4 ohms. so you can use a low-impedance amp to produce much bigger much more powerful bass. more options more power that s what dvc is all about. the bridging adapter is included for an easy single voice coil hookup. it becomes a single 4 ohm or single 8 ohm with bridging adapter for ultimate flexibility for use with modern mono amplifiers    add newly designed spoke grilles   we also recommend covering up your subwoofer with the ud-g308 . this stylish spoke grille is a must add-on when building a system and gives the look of pure professionalism.                        click images above to enlarge.            ts-w2502d2
